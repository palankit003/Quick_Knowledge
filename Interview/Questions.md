### 1. Are you familiar with the rules of hooks in React?

Yes, I am familiar with the rules of hooks in React. In my experience working with React, I've adhered to these rules to ensures that my components function correctly and maintain optimal performance.

The primary rules of hooks include:

1. **Only Call Hooks at the Top level** : Hooks should only be called at the top level of a function component or a custom hook. This ensures that hooks are called in the same order every time a component renders, preserving the state and ensuring React can manage the hooks correctly.

1. **Only Call Hooks from React Functions** : Hooks should only be called from functional components or other custom hooks. This keeps the hook logic within the React execution context.

In my recent project, I built a task management application using React and utilized hooks extensively. For instance, I used `useState` and `useEffect` to manage state and side effects within functional components. One challenge I faced was ensuring hooks were not conditionally called within loops or conditionals, which can lead to unexpected behaviour. By adhering to these rules, I was able to maintain a clean and predictable codebase.

Overall, following the rules of hooks has been crucial in writing effective and maintainable React components.
